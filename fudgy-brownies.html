        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>145g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>250g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>75g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>65g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>80g chopped walnuts</li>

           
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C Fan/350ºF</li>
            <li>Add the butter to a medium saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and cook until the butter melts completely, then turn off the heat. Stay close, and do not let it brown</li>
            <li>While the butter is hot, stir in the sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt. Stir well until blended. Don’t worry if the batter looks gritty. Once you add the eggs, the brownie batter will become smooth.</li>
            <li>Set the saucepan aside to cool until the mixture is warm, not hot, 5 to 10 minutes. Test the temperature by touching the batter, it should be comfortable to hold without feeling hot.</li>
            <li>Add the cold eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each egg.</li>
            <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. I use a wooden spoon or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes</li>
            <li>Stir in nuts or chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Spread the thick brownie batter evenly in the prepared pan. It can be hard to spread because it is so thick. Do your best to push the batter to the corners and even out the top.</li>
            <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle is slightly underbaked, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before removing the brownies from the pan</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
