        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>450g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>50g caster sugar</li>
            <li>100g butter</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>a little milk</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 220°C/200ºC Fan/390ºF.</li>
            <li>Put the flour, baking powder and sugar in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a measuring jug, then add enough milk to make the total liquid 300ml/10fl oz. Using a fork or round-tipped knife, stir the egg and milk into the flour – you may not need it all – and mix to a soft, sticky dough.</li>
            <li>Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface, knead lightly and work in the sultanas, if using. Roll out to a rectangle about 2cm/¾in thick.</li>
            <li>Cut into as many rounds as possible with a fluted 5cm/2in cutter and place them on the prepared baking trays. Brush the tops of the scones with a little extra milk, or any egg and milk left in the jug.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the scones are well risen and a pale, golden-brown colour. Lift onto a wire rack to cool. Eat as fresh as possible.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
